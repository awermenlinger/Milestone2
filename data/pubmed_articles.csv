Eighteen patients (ratio F:M=4:5; average age: 58.2 years; DS: 8.85 years) with severe perforation (more than 10 millimetres of diameter) of the sinus mucosa during the maxillary sinus lift procedure were selected. Normally the procedure is interrupted due to impossible stabilization of the graft material inside the subantral cavity. On the contrary, our protocol foreseen the sealing of the perforation using the PRGF autologous gel membranes or the creation of a new sinus pseudomembrane through which the graft material was covered. The PRGF-Endoret were obtained according to the protocol developed by BTI (Biotechnology Institute - Vitoria, Spain). In 14 cases out of 18 implant fixtures were concurrently inserted while in 4 cases the fixture insertion was postponed after 6 months: 37 fixtures were inserted (27 at the same time and 10 after 6 months). 2 months after surgery the CBCT showed a correct pneumatization of the maxillary sinus in 16 patients out of 18 (89% of cases), while after 12 months the radiological normalization of the maxillary sinus was present in 17 patients out of 18, bringing the healing rate to 94% of cases. Regarding implant healing, 2 out of 37 implants inserted were lost in the first month after the surgical phase, whereas 12 months after prosthesis application the other 35 implants were perfectly osteointegrated with a healing rate equal to 94.6% of the fixtures. 36 months after the surgery all the fixtures were osteointegrated (35 of 37 implants with a percentage of 94.6% of success). We may conclude that the use of PRGF allowed to complete the sinus lift even in case of severe perforation of the sinus mucosa or its total removal thanks to its capability to stabilize the graft, its antibacterial and antifungal activity and its anabolic effect and favouring bone regeneration.",['Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.'],"['Giacomello, M S', 'Mortellaro, C', 'Giacomello, A', 'Scali, J J', 'Greco Lucchina, A']","['Giacomello MS', 'Mortellaro C', 'Giacomello A', 'Scali JJ', 'Greco Lucchina A']","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, Centre of Neuroscience of Milan, University of Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering Saint Camillus International University of Health and Medical Science, Rome, Italy.', 'Private practice, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, Centre of Neuroscience of Milan, University of Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Saint Camillus International University of Health and Medical Science, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Clinical Trial'],Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,['0 (Dental Implants)'],IM,"['Bone Regeneration', '*Dental Implants', 'Humans', 'Maxilla/diagnostic imaging/surgery', '*Maxillary Sinus/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Wound Healing']",['NOTNLM'],"['PRGF-Endoret', 'implant integration', 'membrane perforation', 'perforation sealing', 'platelet concentrates', 'sinus lift']",2021/07/21 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/20 04:48'],"['2021/07/20 04:48 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.23812/21-2supp1-2 [doi]', '2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2021 Mar-Apr;35(2 Suppl. 1):9-19. doi: 10.23812/21-2supp1-2.
