34281299,Management of large perforations of the sinus mucosa with PRGF-Endoret(R) platelet concentrate.,2021/07/20 04:48,"['PRGF-Endoret', 'implant integration', 'membrane perforation', 'perforation sealing', 'platelet concentrates', 'sinus lift']","['Bone Regeneration', '*Dental Implants', 'Humans', 'Maxilla/diagnostic imaging/surgery', '*Maxillary Sinus/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Wound Healing']","The aim of the present study is to describe a new technique through which it is possible to complete the maxillary sinus lift procedure even in case of severe damage or complete removal of the sinus mucosa using the PRGF-Endoret(R) platelet concentrate. Eighteen patients (ratio F:M=4:5; average age: 58.2 years; DS: 8.85 years) with severe perforation (more than 10 millimetres of diameter) of the sinus mucosa during the maxillary sinus lift procedure were selected. Normally the procedure is interrupted due to impossible stabilization of the graft material inside the subantral cavity. On the contrary, our protocol foreseen the sealing of the perforation using the PRGF autologous gel membranes or the creation of a new sinus pseudomembrane through which the graft material was covered. The PRGF-Endoret were obtained according to the protocol developed by BTI (Biotechnology Institute - Vitoria, Spain). In 14 cases out of 18 implant fixtures were concurrently inserted while in 4 cases the fixture insertion was postponed after 6 months: 37 fixtures were inserted (27 at the same time and 10 after 6 months). 2 months after surgery the CBCT showed a correct pneumatization of the maxillary sinus in 16 patients out of 18 (89% of cases), while after 12 months the radiological normalization of the maxillary sinus was present in 17 patients out of 18, bringing the healing rate to 94% of cases. Regarding implant healing, 2 out of 37 implants inserted were lost in the first month after the surgical phase, whereas 12 months after prosthesis application the other 35 implants were perfectly osteointegrated with a healing rate equal to 94.6% of the fixtures. 36 months after the surgery all the fixtures were osteointegrated (35 of 37 implants with a percentage of 94.6% of success). We may conclude that the use of PRGF allowed to complete the sinus lift even in case of severe perforation of the sinus mucosa or its total removal thanks to its capability to stabilize the graft, its antibacterial and antifungal activity and its anabolic effect and favouring bone regeneration."

We report results of avelumab alone or avelumab plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared with PLD alone in patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. METHODS: JAVELIN Ovarian 200 was an open-label, parallel-group, three-arm, randomised, phase 3 trial, done at 149 hospitals and cancer treatment centres in 24 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (maximum of three previous lines for platinum-sensitive disease, none for platinum-resistant disease) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to avelumab (10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks), avelumab plus PLD (40 mg/m(2) intravenously every 4 weeks), or PLD and stratified by disease platinum status, number of previous anticancer regimens, and bulky disease. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival by blinded independent central review and overall survival in all randomly assigned patients, with the objective to show whether avelumab alone or avelumab plus PLD is superior to PLD. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02580058. The trial is no longer enrolling patients and this is the final analysis of both primary endpoints. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 566 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (combination n=188; PLD n=190, avelumab n=188). At data cutoff (Sept 19, 2018), median duration of follow-up for overall survival was 18.4 months (IQR 15.6-21.9) for the combination group, 17.4 months (15.2-21.3) for the PLD group, and 18.2 months (15.8-21.2) for the avelumab group. Median progression-free survival by blinded independent central review was 3.7 months (95% CI 3.3-5.1) in the combination group, 3.5 months (2.1-4.0) in the PLD group, and 1.9 months (1.8-1.9) in the avelumab group (combination vs PLD: stratified HR 0.78 [repeated 93.1% CI 0.59-1.24], one-sided p=0.030; avelumab vs PLD: 1.68 [1.32-2.60], one-sided p>0.99). Median overall survival was 15.7 months (95% CI 12.7-18.7) in the combination group, 13.1 months (11.8-15.5) in the PLD group, and 11.8 months (8.9-14.1) in the avelumab group (combination vs PLD: stratified HR 0.89 [repeated 88.85% CI 0.74-1.24], one-sided p=0.21; avelumab vs PLD: 1.14 [0.95-1.58], one-sided p=0.83]). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (18 [10%] in the combination group vs nine [5%] in the PLD group vs none in the avelumab group), rash (11 [6%] vs three [2%] vs none), fatigue (ten [5%] vs three [2%] vs none), stomatitis (ten [5%] vs five [3%] vs none), anaemia (six [3%] vs nine [5%] vs three [2%]), neutropenia (nine [5%] vs nine [5%] vs none), and neutrophil count decreased (eight [5%] vs seven [4%] vs none). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 32 (18%) patients in the combination group, 19 (11%) in the PLD group, and 14 (7%) in the avelumab group. Treatment-related adverse events resulted in death in one patient each in the PLD group (sepsis) and avelumab group (intestinal obstruction). INTERPRETATION: Neither avelumab plus PLD nor avelumab alone significantly improved progression-free survival or overall survival versus PLD. These results provide insights for patient selection in future studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer.

34122682,"The Effect of Combined Vitamin C and Vitamin E Supplementation on Oxidative Stress Markers in Women with Endometriosis: A Randomized, Triple-Blind Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.",2021/06/14 09:39,,"['Adult', 'Antioxidants/*therapeutic use', 'Ascorbic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Dietary Supplements/analysis', 'Endometriosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Pain Management/*methods', 'Vitamin E/*therapeutic use']","Background: Endometriosis is a chronic and estrogen-dependent pelvic inflammatory disease, which may have various causes, such as oxidative stress. Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain are well-known symptoms of endometriosis. The present clinical trial assessed the role of supplementation with antioxidant vitamins on the indices of oxidative stress as well as the severity of pain in women with endometriosis. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 60 reproductive-aged (15-45 years) women with pelvic pain in this triple-blind clinical trial. They had 1-3 stages of laparoscopic-proven endometriosis. The participants were randomized to group A (n = 30), given vitamin C (1000 mg/day, 2 tablets of 500 mg each) and vitamin E (800 IU/day, 2 tablets of 400 IU each) combination, or group B (n = 30), given placebo pills daily for 8 weeks. Results: Following treatment with vitamin C and vitamin E, we found a significant reduction in MDA and ROS compared with the placebo group. There was no significant decline in total antioxidant capacity after treatment. However, the severity of pelvic pain (p value <0.001), dysmenorrhea (p value <0.001), and dyspareunia (p value <0.001) significantly decreased in the treatment group after 8 weeks of supplementation. Conclusions: The present findings support the potential role of antioxidants in the management of endometriosis. The intake of vitamin C and vitamin E supplements effectively reduced dysmenorrhea severity and improved dyspareunia and severity of pelvic pain."

A randomized, open-label, crossover study was conducted on healthy subjects (n = 26). Each volunteer received 250 mL of fresh pomegranate juice twice daily for 2 weeks. On day 14, they were administered a single oral dose of artemether (80 mg) with either water or 250 mL of pomegranate juice. Thirteen blood samples were collected up to 12 h and 6 electrocardiograms were recorded. Plasma concentrations of artemether and its metabolite dihydroartemisinin were analyzed by a noncompartmental method using LC-MS/MS. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for artemether were estimated as 0.3 and 0.8 ng/mL, respectively, while for dihydroartemisinin it was 0.2 and 0.6 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters of artemether and dihydroartemisinin were not significantly altered when co-administered with the fresh pomegranate juice. AUC (0-infinity) was slightly increased from 742 to 859 ng/mL for artemether [geometric mean ratio: 1.14 (95 % CI, 1.08,1.18); P = 0.45] and from 699 to 818 ng/mL for dihydroartemisinin [geometric mean ratio: 1.15 (95 % CI, 1.09, 1.15); P = 0.4]. Difference in Cmax for artemether was also statistically non-significant [173 vs 195 ng/mL; geometric mean ratio: 1.09 (95 % CI, 0.91, 1.15); P = 0.61]. Likewise, elimination half-life (t1/2) for both artemether and dihydroartemisinin remained unchanged (P = 0.43 and 0.31, respectively). In addition, there was no significant difference in tmax for artemether (P = 0.66) and its metabolite (P = 0.65). In conclusion, findings of the present study demonstrated that the administration of pomegranate juice had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of artemether."
34081625,The effects of psyllium husk on gut microbiota composition and function in chronically constipated women of reproductive age using 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis.,2021/06/03 17:16,"['*16S rRNA gene sequencing', '*chronic constipation', '*gut microbiota', '*metabolism', '*women of reproductive age']","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria/classification', 'Biodiversity', 'Chronic Disease', 'Constipation/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'Placebos', 'Psyllium/*chemistry', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/*genetics', '*Reproduction', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity']","Chronic constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder that occurs in the elderly and in women. Psyllium husk is widely used to treat this condition. Recent studies have shown that psyllium husk can improve the clinical symptoms of constipation by regulating gut microbiota, but its clinical effects and potential mechanisms in constipated women of reproductive age have not been previously investigated. We compared fecal microbiota after treatment with placebo (n = 29) and psyllium husk (n = 25) using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing analysis. Psyllium husk relieved the symptoms of constipated women of reproductive age. Sequencing results showed that the psyllium husk group exhibited a different gut microbiota composition compared to that of the placebo group. Moreover, network analysis indicated more significant correlations and clustering of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the psyllium husk group. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation analysis showed that the relative abundances of metabolism-related KEGG pathways were enriched in the psyllium husk group. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the composition of gut microbiota was altered and that symptoms of constipation were alleviated via psyllium husk intervention. The changes in metabolic function might be related to constipation. Furthermore, these studies are warranted to elucidate the potential metabolic mechanisms contributing to chronic constipation."
34079535,Innate Lymphoid Cells Activation and Transcriptomic Changes in Response to Human Dengue Infection.,2021/06/03 06:40,"['*Dengue', '*ILCs', '*RNA-seq', '*immune response to dengue', '*innate immunity', '*innate lymphoid cells', '*transcriptome', '*viral infection']","['Dengue/*immunology/pathology', 'Dengue Virus/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA-Seq', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/pathology', 'Transcriptome/*immunology']","Background: Dengue virus (DENV) infection has a global impact on public health. The clinical outcomes (of DENV) can vary from a flu-like illness called dengue fever (DF), to a more severe form, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The underlying innate immune mechanisms leading to protective or detrimental outcomes have not been fully elucidated. Helper innate lymphoid cells (hILCs), an innate lymphocyte recently discovered, functionally resemble T-helper cells and are important in inflammation and homeostasis. However, the role of hILCs in DENV infection had been unexplored. Methods: We performed flow cytometry to investigate the frequency and phenotype of hILCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DENV-infected patients of different disease severities (DF and DHF), and at different phases (febrile and convalescence) of infection. Intracellular cytokine staining of hILCs from DF and DHF were also evaluated by flow cytometry after ex vivo stimulation. Further, the hILCs were sorted and subjected to transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare the febrile and convalescent phase samples in DF and DHF. Selected differentially expressed genes were then validated by quantitative PCR. Results: Phenotypic analysis showed marked activation of all three hILC subsets during the febrile phase as shown by higher CD69 expression when compared to paired convalescent samples, although the frequency of hILCs remained unchanged. Upon ex vivo stimulation, hILCs from febrile phase DHF produced significantly higher IFN-gamma and IL-4 when compared to those of DF. Transcriptomic analysis showed unique hILCs gene expression in DF and DHF, suggesting that divergent functions of hILCs may be associated with different disease severities. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that hILCs function both in cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity during the febrile phase of DENV infection. Conclusions: Helper ILCs are activated in the febrile phase of DENV infection and display unique transcriptomic changes as well as cytokine production that correlate with severity. Targeting hILCs during early innate response to DENV might help shape subsequent immune responses and potentially lessen the disease severity in the future."
