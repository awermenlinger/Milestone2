We designed this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that TPVB is superior to placebo in improving the patient quality of recovery following modified radical mastectomy. Patients and Methods: Sixty-eight female patients undergoing elective unilateral modified radical mastectomy were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive preoperative ultrasound-guided TPVB with 0.5% ropivacaine (TPVB group, n=34) or 0.9% saline (Control group, n=34). The primary outcome was quality of recovery, measured 24 h after surgery using the 40-item Quality of recovery questionnaire (QoR-40). Secondary outcomes were the area under the curve of the visual analog scale pain scores over 24 h, postoperative 24-h morphine consumption, time to first rescue analgesia, length of post-anesthesia care unit stay, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and patient satisfaction. Results: The global QoR-40 score 24 h postoperatively (median [interquartile range]) was 173 [170-177] in the TPVB group and 161 [160-164] in the control group (P<0.001), respectively, with a median difference (95% confidence interval) of 11 (9-14). Compared with the control group, preoperative TPVB decreased the area under the curve of the visual analog scale pain scores over 24 h, reduced postoperative 24-h morphine consumption, prolonged the time to first rescue analgesia, shortened the length of post-anesthesia care unit stay, lessened postoperative nausea and vomiting, and improved the patient satisfaction. Conclusion: A single preoperative injection of TPVB with ropivacaine enhances the quality of recovery and postoperative analgesia in patients following modified radical mastectomy."
34448184,Detection of soluble biomarkers of pancreatic cancer in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration samples.,2021/08/27 07:07,,,"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers are urgently needed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is the cornerstone for diagnosing PDAC. We developed a method for discovery of PDAC biomarkers using the discarded EUS-FNA liquid. METHODS: This retrospective study included 58 patients with suspected pancreatic lesions who underwent EUS-FNA. Protein extracts from EUS-FNA liquid were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Proteomic and clinical data were modeled by supervised statistical learning to identify protein markers and clinical variables that distinguish PDAC. RESULTS: Statistical modeling revealed a protein signature for PDAC screening that achieved high sensitivity and specificity (0.92, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.98, and 0.85, 95 %CI 0.67-0.93, respectively). We also developed a protein signature score (PSS) to guide PDAC diagnosis. In combination with patient age, the PSS achieved 100 % certainty in correctly identifying PDAC patients > 54 years. In addition, 3 /4 inconclusive EUS-FNA biopsies were correctly identified using PSS. CONCLUSIONS: EUS-FNA-derived fluid is a rich source of PDAC proteins with biomarker potential. The PSS requires further validation and verification of the feasibility of measuring these proteins in patient sera."
34434051,"Efficacy and Safety of Apatinib for Elderly Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer After Failure of at Least First-Line Chemotherapy: A Multi-Center, Single-Arm, Phase II Study.",2021/08/26 06:08,"['advanced gastric cancer', 'apatinib', 'efficacy', 'elderly patients', 'safety']",,"Background: Apatinib improves progression-free survival and overall survival with an acceptable safety profile in Chinese patients with chemotherapy-refractory advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. However, the efficacy and safety of apatinib are unclear for elderly patients. This study was undertaken to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib for elderly patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, who experienced progression to at least one lines of chemotherapy. Methods: This open-label, single-arm, phase II study enrolled patients aged >/=60 years with advanced gastric cancer, who experienced progression to one or more lines of chemotherapy at five centers in China. Patients received apatinib in an oral dose of 500mg or 250mg daily according to the research physicians' decision. The primary end point was progression-free survival, and the secondary end points were objective response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, and safety. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled between June 2017 and September 2019. The median age was 65.5 years (range 60-80 years). Twenty-seven patients (56.3%) started treatment with an initial dose of 500 mg and 21 patients (43.7%) with 250 mg. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.00 months (95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.84) and 8.10 months (95% confidence interval, 4.35-11.85), respectively. The objective response rate and disease control rate assessed by the investigators were 16.7% and 72.9%, respectively. The common side effects were fatigue (58.3%), hypertension (47.9%), abdominal pain (33.3%), proteinuria (29.2%), leukopenia (22.9%), and neutropenia (20.8%). Hypertension (22.9%) was the major grade 3/4 toxicity. Conclusion: These data suggest that apatinib is effective and relatively tolerable for elderly patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who have received at least first-line chemotherapy."
