We designed this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that TPVB is superior to placebo in improving the patient quality of recovery following modified radical mastectomy. Patients and Methods: Sixty-eight female patients undergoing elective unilateral modified radical mastectomy were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive preoperative ultrasound-guided TPVB with 0.5% ropivacaine (TPVB group, n=34) or 0.9% saline (Control group, n=34). The primary outcome was quality of recovery, measured 24 h after surgery using the 40-item Quality of recovery questionnaire (QoR-40). Secondary outcomes were the area under the curve of the visual analog scale pain scores over 24 h, postoperative 24-h morphine consumption, time to first rescue analgesia, length of post-anesthesia care unit stay, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and patient satisfaction. Results: The global QoR-40 score 24 h postoperatively (median [interquartile range]) was 173 [170-177] in the TPVB group and 161 [160-164] in the control group (P<0.001), respectively, with a median difference (95% confidence interval) of 11 (9-14). Compared with the control group, preoperative TPVB decreased the area under the curve of the visual analog scale pain scores over 24 h, reduced postoperative 24-h morphine consumption, prolonged the time to first rescue analgesia, shortened the length of post-anesthesia care unit stay, lessened postoperative nausea and vomiting, and improved the patient satisfaction. Conclusion: A single preoperative injection of TPVB with ropivacaine enhances the quality of recovery and postoperative analgesia in patients following modified radical mastectomy."
34448184,Detection of soluble biomarkers of pancreatic cancer in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration samples.,2021/08/27 07:07,,,"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers are urgently needed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is the cornerstone for diagnosing PDAC. We developed a method for discovery of PDAC biomarkers using the discarded EUS-FNA liquid. METHODS: This retrospective study included 58 patients with suspected pancreatic lesions who underwent EUS-FNA. Protein extracts from EUS-FNA liquid were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Proteomic and clinical data were modeled by supervised statistical learning to identify protein markers and clinical variables that distinguish PDAC. RESULTS: Statistical modeling revealed a protein signature for PDAC screening that achieved high sensitivity and specificity (0.92, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.98, and 0.85, 95 %CI 0.67-0.93, respectively). We also developed a protein signature score (PSS) to guide PDAC diagnosis. In combination with patient age, the PSS achieved 100 % certainty in correctly identifying PDAC patients > 54 years. In addition, 3 /4 inconclusive EUS-FNA biopsies were correctly identified using PSS. CONCLUSIONS: EUS-FNA-derived fluid is a rich source of PDAC proteins with biomarker potential. The PSS requires further validation and verification of the feasibility of measuring these proteins in patient sera."

However, the efficacy and safety of apatinib are unclear for elderly patients. This study was undertaken to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib for elderly patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, who experienced progression to at least one lines of chemotherapy. Methods: This open-label, single-arm, phase II study enrolled patients aged >/=60 years with advanced gastric cancer, who experienced progression to one or more lines of chemotherapy at five centers in China. Patients received apatinib in an oral dose of 500mg or 250mg daily according to the research physicians' decision. The primary end point was progression-free survival, and the secondary end points were objective response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, and safety. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled between June 2017 and September 2019. The median age was 65.5 years (range 60-80 years). Twenty-seven patients (56.3%) started treatment with an initial dose of 500 mg and 21 patients (43.7%) with 250 mg. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.00 months (95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.84) and 8.10 months (95% confidence interval, 4.35-11.85), respectively. The objective response rate and disease control rate assessed by the investigators were 16.7% and 72.9%, respectively. The common side effects were fatigue (58.3%), hypertension (47.9%), abdominal pain (33.3%), proteinuria (29.2%), leukopenia (22.9%), and neutropenia (20.8%). Hypertension (22.9%) was the major grade 3/4 toxicity. Conclusion: These data suggest that apatinib is effective and relatively tolerable for elderly patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who have received at least first-line chemotherapy."

34429313,Recruitment challenges to the I CARE study: a randomised trial on general practitioner-led colon cancer survivorship care.,2021/08/25 05:45,"['*gastrointestinal tumours', '*primary care', '*qualitative research']","['*Colonic Neoplasms/therapy', '*General Practitioners', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sample Size', 'Survival', 'Survivorship']","OBJECTIVES: The I CARE study (Improving Care After colon canceR treatment in the Netherlands) aims to compare surgeon-led to general practitioner (GP)-led colon cancer survivorship care. Recruitment to the trial took longer than expected. In this descriptive study, recruitment is critically reviewed. SETTING: Patients were recruited from eight Dutch medical centres. PARTICIPANTS: Patients treated with curative intent for stages I-III colon cancer. Target patient sample size was calculated at 300. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to surgeon-led (usual) versus GP-led care, with or without access to an eHealth application (Oncokompas). OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline characteristics of (non-)participants, reasons for non-participation and strategies to improve recruitment were reviewed. RESULTS: Out of 1238 eligible patients, 353 patients were included. Of these, 50 patients dropped out shortly after randomisation and before start of the intervention, resulting in a participation rate of 25%. Participants were on average slightly younger (68.1 years vs 69.3 years) and more often male (67% vs 50%) in comparison to non-participants. A total of 806 patients declined participation for reasons most often relating to research (57%), including the wish to remain in specialist care (31%) and too much effort to participate (12%). Some patients mentioned health (9%) and confrontation with the disease (5%) as a reason. In 43 cases, GPs declined participation, often related to the study objective, need for financial compensation and time restraints. The generally low participation rate led to concerns about reaching the target sample size. Methods to overcome recruitment challenges included changes to the original recruitment procedure and the addition of new study centres. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges were faced in the recruitment to a randomised trial on GP-led colon cancer survivorship care. Research on the transition of care requires sufficient time, funding and support base among patients and healthcare professionals. These findings will help inform researchers and policy-makers on the development of future practices. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR4860."
34429089,The effect of a smartphone application on women's performance and health beliefs about breast self-examination: a quasi-experimental study.,2021/08/25 05:33,"['*Breast neoplasms', '*Breast self-examination', '*Cell phone', '*Health behavior', '*Health belief model', '*Telemedicine']","['Breast Self-Examination', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Motivation', '*Smartphone', 'Software']","BACKGROUND: Breast Self-Examination (BSE) is a simple and inexpensive method for early diagnosis of breast cancer. This study aimed to determine the effect of a smartphone application on women's performance and health beliefs regarding BSE. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, 150 women referring to therapeutic clinics in Jahrom, Iran from December 2019 to May 2020 were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. The intervention group participants had access to a smartphone application including BSE reminder, training, alarm, and feedback to the therapist. The application also contained educational movies and self-assessment. The study data were collected using Champion's Health Belief Model Scale and BSE information record form before and six months after the intervention. Then, the data were entered into the SPSS 21 software and were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, independent t-test, Chi-square, ANCOVA, Mann-Whitney, and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: After the intervention, the largest number of BSEs was four times among 60% of the participants in the intervention group and once among 24% of the participants in the control group during four months (p = 0.001). After the intervention, the mean differences of the scores of perceived susceptibility (1.03 +/- 2.65 vs. 0.01 +/- 0.42, p = 0.001), BSE barriers (2.80 +/- 5.32 vs. 0.04 +/- 1.43, p = 0.001), self-efficacy (10.75 +/- 7.63 vs. - 2.75 +/- 2.44, p = 0.001), and health motivation (2.77 +/- 3.70 vs. - 0.29 +/- 0.63, p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups with regard to perceived severity and BSE benefits after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Access to the smartphone application enhanced the participants' performance and health beliefs regarding BSE in the areas of perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and health motivation. Therefore, we recommend using the same smartphone application to improve women's performance and health beliefs regarding BSE."
