0,34281299,Management of large perforations of the sinus mucosa with PRGF-Endoret(R) platelet concentrate.,['2021/07/20 04:48'],"The aim of the present study is to describe a new technique through which it is possible to complete the maxillary sinus lift procedure even in case of severe damage or complete removal of the sinus mucosa using the PRGF-Endoret(R) platelet concentrate. Eighteen patients (ratio F:M=4:5; average age: 58.2 years; DS: 8.85 years) with severe perforation (more than 10 millimetres of diameter) of the sinus mucosa during the maxillary sinus lift procedure were selected. Normally the procedure is interrupted due to impossible stabilization of the graft material inside the subantral cavity. On the contrary, our protocol foreseen the sealing of the perforation using the PRGF autologous gel membranes or the creation of a new sinus pseudomembrane through which the graft material was covered. The PRGF-Endoret were obtained according to the protocol developed by BTI (Biotechnology Institute - Vitoria, Spain). In 14 cases out of 18 implant fixtures were concurrently inserted while in 4 cases the fixture insertion was postponed after 6 months: 37 fixtures were inserted (27 at the same time and 10 after 6 months). 2 months after surgery the CBCT showed a correct pneumatization of the maxillary sinus in 16 patients out of 18 (89% of cases), while after 12 months the radiological normalization of the maxillary sinus was present in 17 patients out of 18, bringing the healing rate to 94% of cases. Regarding implant healing, 2 out of 37 implants inserted were lost in the first month after the surgical phase, whereas 12 months after prosthesis application the other 35 implants were perfectly osteointegrated with a healing rate equal to 94.6% of the fixtures. 36 months after the surgery all the fixtures were osteointegrated (35 of 37 implants with a percentage of 94.6% of success). We may conclude that the use of PRGF allowed to complete the sinus lift even in case of severe perforation of the sinus mucosa or its total removal thanks to its capability to stabilize the graft, its antibacterial and antifungal activity and its anabolic effect and favouring bone regeneration."
1,34143970,"Avelumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer (JAVELIN Ovarian 200): an open-label, three-arm, randomised, phase 3 study.",['2021/06/18 20:10'],"BACKGROUND: Most patients with ovarian cancer will relapse after receiving frontline platinum-based chemotherapy and eventually develop platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory disease. We report results of avelumab alone or avelumab plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared with PLD alone in patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. METHODS: JAVELIN Ovarian 200 was an open-label, parallel-group, three-arm, randomised, phase 3 trial, done at 149 hospitals and cancer treatment centres in 24 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (maximum of three previous lines for platinum-sensitive disease, none for platinum-resistant disease) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to avelumab (10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks), avelumab plus PLD (40 mg/m(2) intravenously every 4 weeks), or PLD and stratified by disease platinum status, number of previous anticancer regimens, and bulky disease. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival by blinded independent central review and overall survival in all randomly assigned patients, with the objective to show whether avelumab alone or avelumab plus PLD is superior to PLD. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02580058. The trial is no longer enrolling patients and this is the final analysis of both primary endpoints. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 566 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (combination n=188; PLD n=190, avelumab n=188). At data cutoff (Sept 19, 2018), median duration of follow-up for overall survival was 18.4 months (IQR 15.6-21.9) for the combination group, 17.4 months (15.2-21.3) for the PLD group, and 18.2 months (15.8-21.2) for the avelumab group. Median progression-free survival by blinded independent central review was 3.7 months (95% CI 3.3-5.1) in the combination group, 3.5 months (2.1-4.0) in the PLD group, and 1.9 months (1.8-1.9) in the avelumab group (combination vs PLD: stratified HR 0.78 [repeated 93.1% CI 0.59-1.24], one-sided p=0.030; avelumab vs PLD: 1.68 [1.32-2.60], one-sided p>0.99). Median overall survival was 15.7 months (95% CI 12.7-18.7) in the combination group, 13.1 months (11.8-15.5) in the PLD group, and 11.8 months (8.9-14.1) in the avelumab group (combination vs PLD: stratified HR 0.89 [repeated 88.85% CI 0.74-1.24], one-sided p=0.21; avelumab vs PLD: 1.14 [0.95-1.58], one-sided p=0.83]). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (18 [10%] in the combination group vs nine [5%] in the PLD group vs none in the avelumab group), rash (11 [6%] vs three [2%] vs none), fatigue (ten [5%] vs three [2%] vs none), stomatitis (ten [5%] vs five [3%] vs none), anaemia (six [3%] vs nine [5%] vs three [2%]), neutropenia (nine [5%] vs nine [5%] vs none), and neutrophil count decreased (eight [5%] vs seven [4%] vs none). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 32 (18%) patients in the combination group, 19 (11%) in the PLD group, and 14 (7%) in the avelumab group. Treatment-related adverse events resulted in death in one patient each in the PLD group (sepsis) and avelumab group (intestinal obstruction). INTERPRETATION: Neither avelumab plus PLD nor avelumab alone significantly improved progression-free survival or overall survival versus PLD. These results provide insights for patient selection in future studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer.

2,34122682,"The Effect of Combined Vitamin C and Vitamin E Supplementation on Oxidative Stress Markers in Women with Endometriosis: A Randomized, Triple-Blind Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.",['2021/06/14 09:39'],"Background: Endometriosis is a chronic and estrogen-dependent pelvic inflammatory disease, which may have various causes, such as oxidative stress. Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain are well-known symptoms of endometriosis. The present clinical trial assessed the role of supplementation with antioxidant vitamins on the indices of oxidative stress as well as the severity of pain in women with endometriosis. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 60 reproductive-aged (15-45 years) women with pelvic pain in this triple-blind clinical trial. They had 1-3 stages of laparoscopic-proven endometriosis. The participants were randomized to group A (n = 30), given vitamin C (1000 mg/day, 2 tablets of 500 mg each) and vitamin E (800 IU/day, 2 tablets of 400 IU each) combination, or group B (n = 30), given placebo pills daily for 8 weeks. Results: Following treatment with vitamin C and vitamin E, we found a significant reduction in MDA and ROS compared with the placebo group. There was no significant decline in total antioxidant capacity after treatment. However, the severity of pelvic pain (p value <0.001), dysmenorrhea (p value <0.001), and dyspareunia (p value <0.001) significantly decreased in the treatment group after 8 weeks of supplementation. Conclusions: The present findings support the potential role of antioxidants in the management of endometriosis. The intake of vitamin C and vitamin E supplements effectively reduced dysmenorrhea severity and improved dyspareunia and severity of pelvic pain."
3,34082142,"Effect of fresh pomegranate juice on the pharmacokinetic profile of artemether: An open-label, randomized, 2- period crossover study in healthy human volunteers.",['2021/06/03 20:17'],"This study was designed to evaluate the effect of fresh pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) juice on the pharmacokinetic profile of artemether in healthy volunteers. A randomized, open-label, crossover study was conducted on healthy subjects (n = 26). Each volunteer received 250 mL of fresh pomegranate juice twice daily for 2 weeks. On day 14, they were administered a single oral dose of artemether (80 mg) with either water or 250 mL of pomegranate juice. Thirteen blood samples were collected up to 12 h and 6 electrocardiograms were recorded. Plasma concentrations of artemether and its metabolite dihydroartemisinin were analyzed by a noncompartmental method using LC-MS/MS. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for artemether were estimated as 0.3 and 0.8 ng/mL, respectively, while for dihydroartemisinin it was 0.2 and 0.6 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters of artemether and dihydroartemisinin were not significantly altered when co-administered with the fresh pomegranate juice. AUC (0-infinity) was slightly increased from 742 to 859 ng/mL for artemether [geometric mean ratio: 1.14 (95 % CI, 1.08,1.18); P = 0.45] and from 699 to 818 ng/mL for dihydroartemisinin [geometric mean ratio: 1.15 (95 % CI, 1.09, 1.15); P = 0.4]. Difference in Cmax for artemether was also statistically non-significant [173 vs 195 ng/mL; geometric mean ratio: 1.09 (95 % CI, 0.91, 1.15); P = 0.61]. Likewise, elimination half-life (t1/2) for both artemether and dihydroartemisinin remained unchanged (P = 0.43 and 0.31, respectively). In addition, there was no significant difference in tmax for artemether (P = 0.66) and its metabolite (P = 0.65). In conclusion, findings of the present study demonstrated that the administration of pomegranate juice had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of artemether."
4,34081625,The effects of psyllium husk on gut microbiota composition and function in chronically constipated women of reproductive age using 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis.,['2021/06/03 17:16'],"Chronic constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder that occurs in the elderly and in women. Psyllium husk is widely used to treat this condition. Recent studies have shown that psyllium husk can improve the clinical symptoms of constipation by regulating gut microbiota, but its clinical effects and potential mechanisms in constipated women of reproductive age have not been previously investigated. We compared fecal microbiota after treatment with placebo (n = 29) and psyllium husk (n = 25) using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing analysis. Psyllium husk relieved the symptoms of constipated women of reproductive age. Sequencing results showed that the psyllium husk group exhibited a different gut microbiota composition compared to that of the placebo group. Moreover, network analysis indicated more significant correlations and clustering of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the psyllium husk group. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation analysis showed that the relative abundances of metabolism-related KEGG pathways were enriched in the psyllium husk group. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the composition of gut microbiota was altered and that symptoms of constipation were alleviated via psyllium husk intervention. The changes in metabolic function might be related to constipation. Furthermore, these studies are warranted to elucidate the potential metabolic mechanisms contributing to chronic constipation."
5,34079535,Innate Lymphoid Cells Activation and Transcriptomic Changes in Response to Human Dengue Infection.,['2021/06/03 06:40'],"Background: Dengue virus (DENV) infection has a global impact on public health. The clinical outcomes (of DENV) can vary from a flu-like illness called dengue fever (DF), to a more severe form, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The underlying innate immune mechanisms leading to protective or detrimental outcomes have not been fully elucidated. Helper innate lymphoid cells (hILCs), an innate lymphocyte recently discovered, functionally resemble T-helper cells and are important in inflammation and homeostasis. However, the role of hILCs in DENV infection had been unexplored. Methods: We performed flow cytometry to investigate the frequency and phenotype of hILCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DENV-infected patients of different disease severities (DF and DHF), and at different phases (febrile and convalescence) of infection. Intracellular cytokine staining of hILCs from DF and DHF were also evaluated by flow cytometry after ex vivo stimulation. Further, the hILCs were sorted and subjected to transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare the febrile and convalescent phase samples in DF and DHF. Selected differentially expressed genes were then validated by quantitative PCR. Results: Phenotypic analysis showed marked activation of all three hILC subsets during the febrile phase as shown by higher CD69 expression when compared to paired convalescent samples, although the frequency of hILCs remained unchanged. Upon ex vivo stimulation, hILCs from febrile phase DHF produced significantly higher IFN-gamma and IL-4 when compared to those of DF. Transcriptomic analysis showed unique hILCs gene expression in DF and DHF, suggesting that divergent functions of hILCs may be associated with different disease severities. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that hILCs function both in cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity during the febrile phase of DENV infection. Conclusions: Helper ILCs are activated in the febrile phase of DENV infection and display unique transcriptomic changes as well as cytokine production that correlate with severity. Targeting hILCs during early innate response to DENV might help shape subsequent immune responses and potentially lessen the disease severity in the future."
6,34078408,Planned early delivery for late preterm pre-eclampsia in a low- and middle-income setting: a feasibility study.,['2021/06/03 05:42'],"BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity globally. Planned delivery between 34(+0) and 36(+6) weeks may reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes but is yet to be evaluated in a low and middle-income setting. Prior to designing a randomised controlled trial to evaluate this in India and Zambia, we carried out a 6-month feasibility study in order to better understand the proposed trial environment and guide development of our intervention. METHODS: We used mixed methods to understand the disease burden and current management of pre-eclampsia at our proposed trial sites and explore the acceptability of the intervention. We undertook a case notes review of women with pre-eclampsia who delivered at the proposed trial sites over a 3-month period, alongside facilitating focus group discussions with women and partners and conducting semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse audit data. A thematic framework analysis was used for qualitative data. RESULTS: Case notes data (n = 326) showed that in our settings, 19.5% (n = 44) of women with pre-eclampsia delivering beyond 34 weeks experienced an adverse outcome. In women delivering between 34(+0) and 36(+6) weeks, there were similar numbers of antenatal stillbirths [n = 3 (3.3%)] and neonatal deaths [n = 3 (3.4%)]; median infant birthweight was 2.2 kg and 1.9 kg in Zambia and India respectively. Lived experience of women and healthcare providers was an important facilitator to the proposed intervention, highlighting the serious consequences of pre-eclampsia. A preference for spontaneous labour and limited neonatal resources were identified as potential barriers. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a clear need to evaluate the intervention and highlighted several challenges relating to trial context that enabled us to adapt our protocol and design an acceptable intervention. Our study demonstrates the importance of assessing feasibility when developing complex interventions, particularly in a low-resource setting. Additionally, it provides a unique insight into the management of pre-eclampsia at our trial settings and an understanding of the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs underpinning the acceptability of planned early delivery."
7,34069412,COVID-19 Disease Severity and Death in Relation to Vitamin D Status among SARS-CoV-2-Positive UAE Residents.,['2021/06/02 01:25'],"Insufficient blood levels of the neurohormone vitamin D are associated with increased risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Despite the global rollout of vaccinations and promising preliminary results, the focus remains on additional preventive measures to manage COVID-19. Results conflict on vitamin D's plausible role in preventing and treating COVID-19. We examined the relation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality among the multiethnic population of the United Arab Emirates. Our observational study used data for 522 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at one of the main hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Only 464 of those patients were included for data analysis. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Serum samples immediately drawn at the first hospital visit were used to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations through automated electrochemiluminescence. Levels < 12 ng/mL were significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and of death. Age was the only other independent risk factor, whereas comorbidities and smoking did not contribute to the outcomes upon adjustment. Sex of patients was not an important predictor for severity or death. Our study is the first conducted in the UAE to measure 25(OH)D levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and confirm the association of levels < 12 ng/mL with COVID-19 severity and mortality."
8,34037760,"Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir versus the standard of care in adults hospitalized with COVID-19: a single-centre, randomized controlled trial.",['2021/05/26 12:34'],"OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of patients experience asymptomatic to mild self-limited disease, but some cases progress to respiratory and multi-organ failure. However, so far, no approved antiviral therapy has been available for treatment of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) is an approved anti-HCV drug that is capable of suppressing other families of positive-sense RNA viruses with conserved polymerase and may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the SOF/VEL combination in addition to the national standard of care versus the national standard of care alone (hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as supportive care) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This single-centre, randomized, open-labelled, prospective clinical trial was done in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 admitted to Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah Province, Iran. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SOF/VEL arm (SOF/VEL plus the national standard of care) or the control arm (the national standard of care alone). The main outcome of the study was the mortality on Day 28 after randomization. Secondary outcomes were time from the start of medication to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative from the time of randomization to discharge. Adverse events were evaluated in all patients who started their assigned treatment. RESULTS: Between 11 April and 8 June 2020, 80 patients were recruited and randomly assigned into the SOF/VEL (n = 40) and control (n = 40) arms. The primary outcome was not significantly different between the two arms (P = 1.00). Secondary outcomes, including time to clinical improvement, hospital length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation and RT-PCR conversion, were not significantly different between arms either (P > 0.05). SOF/VEL treatment and the national standard of care were tolerated similarly. CONCLUSIONS: Although treatment with SOF/VEL was safe, adding SOF/VEL to the standard of care did not improve the clinical status or reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. However, larger randomized clinical trials including more parameters are needed for accurate estimation of the efficacy of SOF/VEL."

We assessed early metabolic responses to neoadjuvant trastuzumab and pertuzumab using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG)-PET ((18)F-FDG-PET) and the possibility of chemotherapy de-escalation using a pathological response-adapted strategy. METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-comparative, phase 2 trial in 45 hospitals in Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, the UK, Italy, and Portugal. Eligible participants were women aged 18 years or older with centrally confirmed, HER2-positive, stage I-IIIA, invasive, operable breast cancer (>/=1.5 cm tumour size) with at least one breast lesion evaluable by (18)F-FDG-PET, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 55%. We randomly assigned participants (1:4), via an interactive response system using central block randomisation with block sizes of five, stratified by hormone receptor status, to either docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenous), carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve 6 mg/mL per min intravenous), trastuzumab (subcutaneous 600 mg fixed dose), and pertuzumab (intravenous 840 mg loading dose, 420 mg maintenance doses; group A); or trastuzumab and pertuzumab (group B). Hormone receptor-positive patients allocated to group B were additionally given letrozole if postmenopausal (2.5 mg/day orally) or tamoxifen if premenopausal (20 mg/day orally). Centrally reviewed (18)F-FDG-PET scans were done before randomisation and after two treatment cycles. Patients assigned to group A completed six cycles of treatment (every 3 weeks) regardless of (18)F-FDG-PET results. All patients assigned to group B initially received two cycles of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. (18)F-FDG-PET responders in group B continued this treatment for six further cycles; (18)F-FDG-PET non-responders in this group were switched to six cycles of docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab. Surgery was done 2-6 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. Adjuvant treatment was selected according to the neoadjuvant treatment administered, pathological response, hormone receptor status, and clinical stage at diagnosis. The coprimary endpoints were the proportion of (18)F-FDG-PET responders in group B with a pathological complete response in the breast and axilla (ypT0/is ypN0) as determined by a local pathologist after surgery after eight cycles of treatment, and 3-year invasive disease-free survival of patients in group B, both assessed by intention to treat. The definitive assessment of pathological complete response was done at this primary analysis; follow-up to assess invasive disease-free survival is continuing, hence these data are not included in this Article. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Health-related quality-of-life was assessed with EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires at baseline, after two cycles of treatment, and before surgery. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2016-002676-27) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03161353), and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 26, 2017, and April 24, 2019, we randomly assigned 71 patients to group A and 285 to group B. Median follow-up was 5.7 months (IQR 5.3-6.0). 227 (80%) of 285 patients in group B were (18)F-FDG-PET responders, of whom 86 (37.9%, 95% CI 31.6-44.5; p<0.0001 compared with the historical rate) of 227 had a pathological complete response. The most common haematological grade 3-4 adverse events were anaemia (six [9%] of 68 patients in group A vs four [1%] of 283 patients in group B), neutropenia (16 [24%] vs ten [4%]), and febrile neutropenia (14 [21%] vs 11 [4%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 20 (29%) of 68 patients in group A versus 13 (5%) of 283 patients in group B. No deaths were reported during neoadjuvant treatment. Global health status declined by at least 10% in 65.0% (95% CI 46.5-72.4) and 35.5% (29.7-41.7) of patients in groups A and B, respectively INTERPRETATION: (18)F-FDG-PET identified patients with HER2-positive, early-stage breast cancer who were likely to benefit from chemotherapy-free dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, and a reduced impact on global health status. Depending on the forthcoming results for the 3-year invasive disease-free survival endpoint, this strategy might be a valid approach to select patients not requiring chemotherapy.

10,33994796,A Phase I Trial of the MET/ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor Crizotinib Combined with the VEGF Inhibitor Pazopanib in Patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies.,['2021/05/17 05:59'],"Background: Crizotinib inhibits ALK, MET and ROS1 tyrosine kinases but the development of resistance to monotherapy is an issue. The anti-angiogenic properties of pazopanib could overcome crizotinib drug resistance. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic properties of crizotinib could augment the clinical efficacy of pazopanib. Methods: We evaluated the safety and responses in patients with advanced solid tumors treated with crizotinib and pazopanib. Results: Eighty-two patients (median age 53 years, range 18-78 years) were enrolled. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3 (range, 0-8). We were able to dose escalate to dose level 8 (crizotinib 250 mg twice daily and pazopanib 800 mg daily) with no MTD identified. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were seen in 32% of patients with the highest prevalence being fatigue (n=9, 11%), diarrhea (n=6, 7%), vomiting (n=3, 4%), anemia (n=2, 2%) and ALT increased (n=2, 2%). Of the 82 patients, 61 (74%) had measurable disease by RECISTv1.1 and reached first restaging (6 weeks). Partial response (PR) was observed in 6/61 (10%) patients, and stable disease (SD) lasting >/=6 months was observed in 10/61 patients (16%) (total = 16/61 (26%) of patients with SD >/=6 months/PR). Conclusion: Dose level 6 (crizotinib 200 mg twice daily and pazopanib 600 mg daily) was the most tolerable dosing of the combination and can be used in future studies. We also observed moderate clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumors that had received numerous prior therapies."

Loncastuximab tesirine is a CD19-directed antibody-drug conjugate with encouraging phase 1 single-agent antitumour activity and acceptable safety in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We aimed to evaluate the antitumour activity and safety of loncastuximab tesirine in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. METHODS: We did a multicentre (28 hospital sites in the USA, UK, Italy, and Switzerland), open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial (LOTIS-2) in patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory DLBCL after two or more multiagent systemic treatments, who had measurable disease and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2. Eligible patients received loncastuximab tesirine intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, at 150 mug/kg for two cycles, then 75 mug/kg thereafter, for up to 1 year or until disease relapse or progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, major protocol deviation, pregnancy, or patient, investigator, or sponsor decision. The primary endpoint was overall response rate assessed by central review. Primary antitumour activity and safety analyses were done in the as-treated population (patients who received at least one dose of loncastuximab tesirine), when all responding patients had at least 6 months of follow-up after initial documented response. Enrolment is complete. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03589469. FINDINGS: Between Aug 1, 2018, and Sept 24, 2019, 184 patients were assessed for eligibility and 145 (79%) were enrolled and received at least one dose of loncastuximab tesirine, including patients with high-risk characteristics for poor prognosis, such as double-hit, triple-hit, transformed, or primary refractory DLBCL. 70 of 145 patients had complete or partial response (overall response rate 48.3% [95% CI 39.9-56.7]); 35 had complete response and 35 had partial response. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (37 [26%] of 145 patients), thrombocytopenia (26 [18%]), and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (24 [17%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 57 (39%) of 145 patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events with a fatal outcome occurred in eight (6%) of 145 patients; none were considered related to loncastuximab tesirine. INTERPRETATION: Loncastuximab tesirine has substantial single-agent antitumour activity and produces durable responses with an acceptable safety profile, potentially offering a new therapeutic option for heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.

12,33947099,Assessment of Body Composition and Dietary Intake in Nursing-Home Residents: Could Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic Be Used to Prevent Future Casualties in Older Individuals?,['2021/05/05 01:03'],"The population of older adults, especially those living in the nursing homes, is growing. The sedentary lifestyle and possible poor nutrition in nursing homes place residents (NHRs) at risk for body composition impairments, malnutrition, and, subsequently, numerous chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess body composition (including body fluids) and dietary intake in NHRs. The association between osteosarcopenic adiposity syndrome (OSA) and its components, osteopenic adiposity (OA), sarcopenic adiposity (SA), and adiposity-only (AD), and specific macro- and micro-nutrients was evaluated as well. The study included 84 participants (82.1% women), aged 65.3-95.2 years. Body composition was assessed with an advanced bioelectrical impedance device BIA-ACC((R)) and dietary intake was assessed via 24-h recall and analyzed using ""Nutrition"" software. The majority (95%) of participants were overweight with a high body fat and low muscle and bone mass, leading to a high prevalence of OSA (>50%), OA (13%), and AD (26%). There were only a few participants with SA, and they were not analyzed. The highest extracellular water/total body water ratio was observed in the OSA participants, indicating a heightened inflammatory state. Participants in all three body composition categories had a similar nutrient intake, with protein, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and almost all micronutrients being far below recommendations. In conclusion, a high prevalence of OSA among NHRs accompanied by a poor dietary intake, could place these residents at a very high risk for COVID-19 infections. Therefore, optimization of body composition and nutritional status should be included along with standard medical care in order to provide better health maintenance, particularly in the COVID-19 era."
13,33916192,"The Effectiveness of Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus casei Strains in Children with Atopic Dermatitis and Cow's Milk Protein Allergy: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Study.",['2021/04/30 01:02'],"Probiotics seem to have promising effects in the prevention and treatment of allergic conditions including atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy. The purpose of this multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a probiotic preparation comprising Lactobacillus rhamnosus LOCK 0900, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LOCK 0908, and Lactobacillus casei LOCK 0918 in children under 2 years of age with AD and a cow's milk protein (CMP) allergy. The study enrolled 151 children, who-apart from being treated with a CMP elimination diet-were randomized to receive the probiotic preparation at a daily dose of 10(9) bacteria or a placebo for three months, with a subsequent nine-month follow-up. The primary outcomes included changes in AD symptom severity assessed with the scoring AD (SCORAD) index and in the proportion of children with symptom improvement (a SCORAD score decreased by at least 30% in comparison with that at baseline). After the three-month intervention, both the probiotic and placebo groups showed a significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in SCORAD scores, which was maintained nine months later. The percentage of children who showed improvement was significantly higher in the probiotic than in the placebo group (odds ratio (OR) 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-5.8; p = 0.012) after three months. Probiotics induced SCORAD improvement mainly in allergen sensitized patients (OR 6.03; 95% CI 1.85-19.67, p = 0.001), but this positive effect was not observed after nine months. The results showed that the mixture of probiotic LOCK strains offers benefits for children with AD and CMP allergy. Further research is necessary to assess the effect of probiotic supplementation on the development of immune tolerance (NCT04738565)."
14,33909203,Neratinib + capecitabine sustains health-related quality of life in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and >/= 2 prior HER2-directed regimens.,['2021/04/28 12:27'],"PURPOSE: To characterize health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) from the NALA phase 3 study. METHODS: In NALA (NCT01808573), patients were randomized 1:1 to neratinib + capecitabine (N + C) or lapatinib + capecitabine (L + C). HRQoL was assessed using seven prespecified scores from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality Of Life Questionnaire core module (QLQ-C30) and breast cancer-specific questionnaire (QLQ-BR23) at baseline and every 6 weeks. Descriptive statistics summarized scores over time, mixed models evaluated differences between treatment arms, and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess time to deterioration in HRQoL scores of >/= 10 points. RESULTS: Of the 621 patients randomized in NALA, patients were included in the HRQoL analysis if they completed baseline and at least one follow-up questionnaire. The summary, global health status, physical functioning, fatigue, constipation, and systemic therapy side effects scores were stable over time with no persistent differences between treatment groups. There were no differences in time to deterioration (TTD) for the QLQ-C30 summary score between treatment arms; the hazard ratio (HR) for N + C vs. L + C was 0.94 (95% CI 0.63-1.40). Only the diarrhea score worsened significantly more in the N + C arm as compared to the L + C arm, and this remained over time (HR for TTD for N + C vs. L + C was 1.71 [95% CI 1.32-2.23]). CONCLUSION: In NALA, patients treated with N + C maintained their global HRQoL over time, despite a worsening of the diarrhea-related scores. These results may help guide optimal treatment selection for HER2-positive MBC."
15,33902485,Predicting outcomes in older ED patients with influenza in real time using a big data-driven and machine learning approach to the hospital information system.,['2021/04/27 05:39'],"BACKGROUND: Predicting outcomes in older patients with influenza in the emergency department (ED) by machine learning (ML) has never been implemented. Therefore, we conducted this study to clarify the clinical utility of implementing ML. METHODS: We recruited 5508 older ED patients (>/=65 years old) in three hospitals between 2009 and 2018. Patients were randomized into a 70%/30% split for model training and testing. Using 10 clinical variables from their electronic health records, a prediction model using the synthetic minority oversampling technique preprocessing algorithm was constructed to predict five outcomes. RESULTS: The best areas under the curves of predicting outcomes were: random forest model for hospitalization (0.840), pneumonia (0.765), and sepsis or septic shock (0.857), XGBoost for intensive care unit admission (0.902), and logistic regression for in-hospital mortality (0.889) in the testing data. The predictive model was further applied in the hospital information system to assist physicians' decisions in real time. CONCLUSIONS: ML is a promising way to assist physicians in predicting outcomes in older ED patients with influenza in real time. Evaluations of the effectiveness and impact are needed in the future."
16,33882374,Study of the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune T-cell responses in COVID-19-positive cancer patients.,['2021/04/21 20:10'],"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are considered highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, delaying cancer-specific therapies could have a deleterious effect on survival. The potential suppressive effects of chemotherapies or cancer-related microenvironment raised the question on how cancer patients' immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: We have started a prospective monocentric trial entitled COV-CREM (NCT04365322) in April 2020. The primary objective of the trial was to assess specific immune response's intensity and diversity to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that cancer patients (28 solid tumours, 11 haematological malignancies) exposed to SARS-CoV-2 produced a high rate of specific antibodies, as observed in patients without a cancer history (n = 29). However, our results highlight a lack in the generation of T-cell responses against CoV-N, M and S proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, suggesting that cancer patients failed to mount a protective T-cell immunity. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not impair established immune memory since specific responses against common viruses were not hampered in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Given the severity and the unknown evolution of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is of fundamental importance to integrate cancer patients in vaccination programs."
17,33877728,"Effects of melatonin supplementation on serum oxidative stress markers and disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus patients: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",['2021/04/20 12:31'],"BACKGROUND: Considering pathological significance of oxidative stress in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), current research aimed to evaluate the effects of melatonin supplementation on oxidative stress markers and disease activity in SLE. METHOD: In this randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 32 SLE females were selected and randomly assigned into two groups to take 10 mg/day melatonin or placebo for 12 weeks. Before and after trial, serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured and disease activity was determined by Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (13 in the melatonin and 12 in the placebo groups) completed the trial. Melatonin supplementation caused significant reduction in serum MDA compared with baseline (P = .003) and placebo group (P = .004). Serum TAC level did not change significantly in the melatonin group compared with baseline and placebo group (P > .05). Furthermore, melatonin supplementation did not cause significant change in disease activity compared to baseline and placebo group (P > .05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated affirmative effects of melatonin in decreasing oxidative stress in SLE patients without any effect on disease activity. Further investigations are required to affirm these primitive findings and to achieve concise conclusions.What's known Free radical damage and oxidative stress has a remarkable function in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. Products derived from oxidative modification cascades are found in biological fluids and their redundancy has a correlation with disease activity and organ damage in SLE. Dietary supplements, which decrease oxidative stress, would be useful in managing SLE. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory characteristics. Limited in vitro and animal studies are available indicating desirable effects of melatonin in preventing from SLE organ damage, thereby opening a new area of investigation that can contribute to using melatonin as a therapy or co-therapy for SLE. What's new Melatonin supplementation caused significant reduction in serum MDA compared with baseline and placebo group. Serum TAC level did not change significantly in the melatonin group compared with baseline and placebo group. Furthermore, melatonin supplementation did not cause significant change in disease activity compared to baseline and placebo group."
18,33877274,Effect of Poloxamer 188 vs Placebo on Painful Vaso-Occlusive Episodes in Children and Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,['2021/04/20 12:18'],"Importance: Although effective agents are available to prevent painful vaso-occlusive episodes of sickle cell disease (SCD), there are no disease-modifying therapies for ongoing painful vaso-occlusive episodes; treatment remains supportive. A previous phase 3 trial of poloxamer 188 reported shortened duration of painful vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD, particularly in children and participants treated with hydroxyurea. Objective: To reassess the efficacy of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial conducted from May 2013 to February 2016 that included 66 hospitals in 12 countries and 60 cities; 388 individuals with SCD (hemoglobin SS, SC, S-beta0 thalassemia, or S-beta+ thalassemia disease) aged 4 to 65 years with acute moderate to severe pain typical of painful vaso-occlusive episodes requiring hospitalization were included. Interventions: A 1-hour 100-mg/kg loading dose of poloxamer 188 intravenously followed by a 12-hour to 48-hour 30-mg/kg/h continuous infusion (n = 194) or placebo (n = 194). Main Outcomes and Measures: Time in hours from randomization to the last dose of parenteral opioids among all participants and among those younger than 16 years as a separate subgroup. Results: Of 437 participants assessed for eligibility, 388 were randomized (mean age, 15.2 years; 176 [45.4%] female), the primary outcome was available for 384 (99.0%), 15-day follow-up contacts were available for 357 (92.0%), and 30-day follow-up contacts were available for 368 (94.8%). There was no significant difference between the groups for the mean time to last dose of parenteral opioids (81.8 h for the poloxamer 188 group vs 77.8 h for the placebo group; difference, 4.0 h [95% CI, -7.8 to 15.7]; geometric mean ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.5]; P = .09). Based on a significant interaction of age and treatment (P = .01), there was a treatment difference in time from randomization to last administration of parenteral opioids for participants younger than 16 years (88.7 h in the poloxamer 188 group vs 71.9 h in the placebo group; difference, 16.8 h [95% CI, 1.7-32.0]; geometric mean ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8]; P = .008). Adverse events that were more common in the poloxamer 188 group than the placebo group included hyperbilirubinemia (12.7% vs 5.2%); those more common in the placebo group included hypoxia (12.0% vs 5.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children and adults with SCD, poloxamer 188 did not significantly shorten time to last dose of parenteral opioids during vaso-occlusive episodes. These findings do not support the use of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01737814."
19,33868301,Lung Neutrophilic Recruitment and IL-8/IL-17A Tissue Expression in COVID-19.,['2021/04/19 06:21'],"The new SARS-CoV-2 virus differs from the pandemic Influenza A virus H1N1 subtype (H1N1pmd09) how it induces a pro-inflammatory response in infected patients. This study aims to evaluate the involvement of SNPs and tissue expression of IL-17A and the neutrophils recruitment in post-mortem lung samples from patients who died of severe forms of COVID-19 comparing to those who died by H1N1pdm09. Twenty lung samples from patients SARS-CoV-2 infected (COVID-19 group) and 10 lung samples from adults who died from a severe respiratory H1N1pdm09 infection (H1N1 group) were tested. The tissue expression of IL-8/IL-17A was identified by immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain slides were used for neutrophil scoring. DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks, and genotyping was done in real time-PCR for two IL17A target polymorphisms. Tissue expression increasing of IL-8/IL-17A and a higher number of neutrophils were identified in samples from the H1N1 group compared to the COVID-19 group. The distribution of genotype frequencies in the IL17A gene was not statistically significant between groups. However, the G allele (GG and GA) of rs3819025 was correlated with higher tissue expression of IL-17A in the COVID-19 group. SARS-CoV-2 virus evokes an exacerbated response of the host's immune system but differs from that observed in the H1N1pdm09 infection since the IL-8/IL-17A tissue expression, and lung neutrophilic recruitment may be decreased. In SNP rs3819025 (G/A), the G allele may be considered a risk allele in the patients who died for COVID-19."
20,33861459,Protective Effects of Intravenous Magnesium Sulfate in Stroke Patients Receiving Amiodarone: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,['2021/04/16 12:20'],"Anti-arrhythmic agents, like amiodarone, interfere at different stages of the ischemic stroke. However, amiodarone was accompanied with immunological pulmonary complications and adverse neurological effects. We hypothesize that magnesium sulfate in combination with amiodarone holds promise for stroke treatment. Thirty-six patients with confirmed diagnosis of ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation who received bolus amiodarone were randomly assigned to magnesium sulfate every 24 h or similar volume of normal saline (as placebo) for 5 days. Various severity test scores were used to evaluate the symptoms. Routing biochemistry were also measured at days 1 and 5. Treatment with MgSO4 results in a significant reduction in serum levels of NGAL, Hb, T.Bill, IL-6, IL-8, SNSE, S100B, EGF, PAF, CRP and IgG. Also, MgSO4 treatment significantly improved the RASS, Candida, SOFA, NIHSS and APACHE scores. Moreover, reduction of IL-6, IL-8, SNSE, EGF and APACHE score and increase in RASS score were significantly higher in MgSO4 group compared with placebo. Intravenous administration of MgSO4 in amiodarone-treated stroke patients improved the inflammatory, immunological and neurological indicators and reduced disability in ICU-admitted AIS patients, suggesting that this treatment scheme may prevent amiodarone-induced complications in these patients."
21,33861441,Effect of Curcumin on Severity of Functional Dyspepsia: a Triple Blinded Clinical Trial.,['2021/04/16 12:19'],"BackgroundFunctional dyspepsia is the main cause of upper abdominal discomfort affecting 5-10% of the world population. Despite various therapeutic approaches, up to 50% of patients with functional dyspepsia seek alternative treatments. In the present study we evaluated the effect of curcumin supplementation along with famotidine therapy on severity of functional dyspepsia. A total of 75 patients with functional dyspepsia according to Rome III criteria were allocated into intervention (N = 39) or control (N = 36) groups. The intervention group was treated with a combination of 500 mg curcumin and 40 mg famotidine daily for 1 month. The control group received placebo and 40 mg famotidine. Severity of dyspepsia symptoms was determined using the Hong Kong questionnaire at baseline, after the 1 month treatment and after a 1 month follow-up. The presence of H. pylori antigens in the stool samples was also investigated in all subjects. No significant difference was observed between intervention and control groups in biochemical indices, severity of dyspepsia and rate of H. pylori infection. A significant decrease was observed in severity of dyspepsia (p < 0.001) and rate of H. pylori infection (p = 0.004) immediately after the treatment and follow-up in the curcumin intervention group. This study indicated that curcumin therapy could be a favorable supplementation in the symptom management of functional dyspepsia. Moreover, curcumin could help efficient eradication of H. pylori in these patients."
22,33861440,Therapeutic Effect of Curcumin in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Receiving Metformin: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,['2021/04/16 12:19'],"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, for which the insulin sensitizer metformin has been used therapeutically. It has been shown that curcumin also exhibits insulin-sensitizing properties. Given that metformin acts as an ovulation inducing agent and both curcumin and metformin can reduce insulin resistance, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of metformin with and without curcumin nanomicelles in the treatment of women with polycystic ovary syndrome. This clinical trial was conducted on 100 women with PCOS, diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria, who were sequentially recruited and randomly divided into two groups (n = 50 each). Group 1 received 500 mg metformin three times daily and group 2 received 80 mg/day capsule of curcumin nanomicelle and 500 mg metformin three times a day for 3 months. After collecting fasting blood samples, biochemical parameters including triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, plasma glucose, alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were evaluated based on enzymatic methods. Hormonal parameters were assessed using immunoassay kits. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were also assessed. After treatment, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and total testosterone in group 2 were significantly lower than those in group 1 (p < 0.05). Post-treatment LDL-C levels in groups 1 and 2 were 117.9 +/- 24 and 91.12 +/- 19.46 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.01). In addition, HDL-C levels were increased with curcumin (group 1: 38.1 +/- 4.36 mg/dL; group 2: 44.12 +/- 7.3 mg/dL, p < 0.05). Total cholesterol was decreased with curcumin level (group 1: 207.9 +/- 39.84 mg/dL; group 2; 159.7 +/- 48.43 mg/dL, p < 0.05), with a decrease in triglycerides levels (group 1: 141.6 +/- 9.57; group 2: 97.5 +/- 8.8 mg/dL, p < 0.01). This study showed that curcumin has a synergistic effect with metformin in the improvement of insulin resistance and lipid profile in patients with PCOS. Therefore, the combined use of metformin and curcumin may have therapeutic utility in patients with PCOS."

It is strongly associated with conditions of insulin resistance including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. It has detrimental consequences ranged from simple steatosis to irreversible hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Curcumin is a dietary polyphenol with potential effect in improving NAFLD. Therefore, the aim of this trial was to examine the effect of curcumin supplementation on various aspects of NAFLD. In this trial, a total number of 80 patients were randomised to receive either curcumin at 250 mg daily or placebo for 2 months. Lipid profiles, hepatic enzymes, anthropometric indices and hepatic fat mass were assessed at the baseline and the end of the trial, and compared within the groups. The grade of hepatic steatosis, and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were significantly reduced in the curcumin group (p = 0.015 and p = 0.007, respectively) compared to the placebo. There was also a significant reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and anthropometric indices in both groups with no significant differences between the two groups. Low dose phospholipid curcumin supplementation each day for 2 months showed significant reduction in hepatic steatosis and enzymes in patients with NAFLD compared to placebo. Further studies of longer duration and higher dosages are needed to assess its effect on other parameters of NAFLD including cardiovascular risk."
24,33861432,"The Effect of Curcumin Supplementation on Pulse Wave Velocity in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.",['2021/04/16 12:19'],"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in many societies. Arterial stiffness is an initial sign of structural and functional changes in the arterial wall. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is the gold standard for non-invasive evaluation of aortic stiffness and a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Curcumin is a major component of turmeric with known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Since arterial stiffness is affected by inflammation and oxidative stress, it may be improved by curcumin supplementation. The purpose of this clinical trial was to investigate the potential effects of curcumin on improving arterial stiffness in patients with metabolic syndrome. This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted among metabolic syndrome patients. Sixty-six eligible individuals were randomly assigned to active intervention or control groups. The active intervention group received curcumin supplement at a dose of 500 mg daily for 12 weeks, whereas the control group received placebo capsule. Physical activity, daily dietary energy intake, anthropometric body composition, and biochemical hemodynamic and arterial stiffness parameters were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study. Body weight decreased significantly in the curcumin group compared to placebo. Also, curcumin intervention improved PWV, which remained significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors (p = 0.011). The current clinical trial demonstrated that daily intake of 500 mg of curcumin for 12 weeks can lead to the improvement of arterial stiffness and weight management among subjects with metabolic syndrome."

In addition, TCV is preferred at most ages owing to its improved immunological properties as it overcomes the limitation of Vi polysaccharide vaccines. Here, we assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a TCV, Vi-CRM197, termed EuTCV, in an open-label clinical phase I study in healthy Filipino adults. This study was conducted in 75 healthy adults aged 18-45 years who were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio based on the vaccines administered: EuTCV (Test), Typbar-TCV(R) (WHO prequalified vaccine) and Typhim Vi(R) (Vi polysaccharide vaccine). The study vaccines were administered at a dose of 25 microg of Vi-CRM197 conjugate by intramuscular injection as a single dose to each of the 25 participants/group, and their immunogenicity and overall safety were assessed for 42 days post-vaccination. All study participants (n = 25/group) completed the trial without dropouts. There were no deaths, SAEs, or events leading to premature withdrawal from the study. Anti-Vi IgG antibody titer (geometric mean titer) of EuTCV group on day 42 was 65.325 [95% CI (36.860, 115.771)], which was significantly higher than that of the WHO prequalified TCV [24.795, 95% CI (16.164, 38.033) p = 0.0055] and the Vi polysaccharide vaccine [7.998, 95% CI (3.800, 16.835) p < 0.0001]. Moreover, the seroconversion rate of EuTCV and Typbar-TCV(R) was 100%, but that of Typhim Vi(R) was only 84%. The IgG1-3 subclass titers and serum bactericidal assay results in the EuTCV group showed higher and better bactericidal capacity than the other groups. EuTCV was well tolerated and exhibited an acceptable safety profile in the study population. The Vi-CRM197 conjugate dose of 25 mug may be considered effective in terms of efficacy and safety.
