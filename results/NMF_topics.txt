9: pain assessment is the basis for adequate treatment .<n> assessment of pain is the basis for adequate treatment , however , it is difficult to assess the intensity of pain .<n> one of the reasons for this difficulty is that patients do not always comply with recall procedures .<n> one of the reasons for this difficulty is that patients do not always report pain intensity to the nurse .<n> a study was undertaken to evaluate this problem .<n> a scale was set up in a hospital pain

10: in metastatic colorectal cancer ( crc ) , the inhibition of oncogenic kinase activity by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor , avacizumab , results in an increased incidence of oncogenic mutations .<n> the inhibition of oncogenic kinase activity in colorectal cancer ( crc ) is considered to be a novel strategy for the treatment of crc .<n> however , the use of avacizumab in the treatment of crc has been limited by its toxicity
